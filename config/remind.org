- [ ] emacs 27 has built in tab support. Consider re-implementing eshring with this
- [ ] add gnus
- [ ] display-fill-column-indicator-mode
- [ ] `hide-show-minor-mode' can be used for code folding
- [ ] dired should compress files asynchronously
- [ ] images in org files should be embedded as base64 strings in html export
- [ ] figure out why org isn't working with xdg-open
- [ ] fix dired-collapse-mode from breaking j -> dired-goto-file
- [ ] fix the shitty man prompt. make it so different manuals are expanded in
  the first selection and it doesn't drop down to another selection list e.g:
  - malloc(1)
  - malloc(3)
  - malloc(3p) ...
- [ ] make all shell execs static (i.e. save contents to file and load that file.)
